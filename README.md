# Gender-discrimination-in-academia

#Project Overview

It is believed that discrimination in academia has been decreased over time. However, gender discrimination is truly a subtle form of prejudice that has a striking impact on all aspects of life. The level of gender discrimination has been analyzed in the five different departments of the Houston College of Medicine. Female doctors claimed that the College has engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against women in giving promotions and setting salaries. Data explorations helps to reveal hidden patterns in raw data and well understand the relation between features. In terms of different departments involved in this claim, analyzing each department is indispensable to perceive the level and type of gender gap in medical school.
